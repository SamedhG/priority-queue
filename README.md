# Priority Queues

This crate will provide several different implementations of MPMC Priority
queues
Couple of implementations will be based on this blog post: 
http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/queues/priority-queues
Another implementation i want to try is:
https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Fast-and-lock-free-concurrent-priority-queues-for-Sundell-Tsigas/3872ccb40b44e0a7af38a1e6fdeb35754dfce9d2

I have initially added a reference implementation so ther implementations can be
benchmarked against it
